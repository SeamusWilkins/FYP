The datasets I created for training both the benign and poisoned model are in /datasets

The models that were produced from finetuning [Hermes](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Mistral-7B) on these are in /LoRAs
They are LoRA's and can be applied on top of Hermes to use them. 

Finetuning was facillitated with this [UI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), it can also be used for applying the LoRA's to Hermes and testing them
